General

MetaRacing is an NFT lottery platform that allows users to buy and trade digital collectibles representing racing cars. The platform is designed to create a fun and engaging experience for users while providing them with the opportunity to win valuable prizes through a randomized lottery system. MetaRacing uses blockchain technology to ensure transparency and fairness in the selection of lottery winners.

Introduction

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the world of digital collectibles by enabling users to own unique and valuable assets that cannot be duplicated or counterfeited. MetaRacing leverages this technology to create an exciting new way for users to participate in lotteries and win valuable prizes.
Meta Racing is a Play-to-earn blockchain-based racing game.
Our vision is to integrate the Play-and-earn models within our gaming system, enabling individuals to easily engage with the MetaRacing game without the need for substantial upfront investments in NFTs.
